using lambda functions - use Optional<>

task has three properties
- id (int)
- description (string
- status (Enum)

ignore case when checking for matches
use string formatting - including left and right alignment
menu options can be either lower or upper case

restrictions:
cannot add duplicates
cannot mark pending tasks pending
cannot mark done tasks done
cannot mark cancelled tasks cancelled

display tasks by status by name
- first pending
- then done
- then cancelled

use input validation for invalid values - prompt to try again
use unicode character for tick mark with done tasks
